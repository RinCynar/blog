Through ten thousand miles of haze, deep autumn waters lay,
<br>
A thousand mountains, flowers fall, their trace fades away.
<br>
Bathed in warm sunlight, amidst spring's gentle breeze,
<br>
My heart awaits the winter snow, covering all with ease.
<br>
<br>
No illness shall bind me, no fetters hold me tight,
<br>
I seek the underworld, tracing shadows in the night.
<br>
My body youthful as wings of a fledgling bird,
<br>
But my spirit lacks luster, its brilliance blurred.
<br>
<br>
Do not speak of distractions, or minds that fray,
<br>
Echoes guide me, but lead me astray.
<br>
Those who've passed, there's no lingering tie,
<br>
Should I grasp at their essence before I die?
<br>
<br>
In this realm of worldly desires, my journey nears its end,
<br>
Finding a sympathetic ear, my affection I extend.
<br>
May death be but a final flame,
<br>
To fulfill my ambitions, regardless of strain.
