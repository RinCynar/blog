> **💡 Preface:** This guide is based on real-world testing on a Surface Pro 6 (i5-8350U / 8GB / 256GB). After these optimizations, C: drive free space increased from **85GB to 114GB** (a **29GB** gain), with significantly snappier system responsiveness.
> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** These tweaks involve deep system modifications. It is highly recommended to create a **System Restore Point** before proceeding.

## 1. Performance & CPU Optimization

### 1.1 Disable VBS (Core Isolation)

VBS consumes significant CPU cycles. Disabling it can improve performance by 10-15%.

* **GUI Method**: `Settings` -> `Privacy & security` -> `Windows Security` -> `Device security` -> `Core isolation details` -> Turn off **Memory integrity**.
* **CLI Method** (Admin PowerShell):
```powershell
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

```


* *Reboot required.*

### 1.2 Windows Defender Fine-tuning

Instead of brute-force removal, "blind" it via exclusions and policy tweaks.

* **Process Exclusions**:
Add `explorer.exe` and `SearchIndexer.exe` to the exclusion list in Windows Security to reduce overhead.
* **Disable Real-time Protection** (Requires **Tamper Protection** to be OFF first):
```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning $true

```


* **Optimize Scheduled Tasks**:
Navigate to `Task Scheduler` -> `Microsoft\Windows\Windows Defender` and disable the triggers under "Conditions" for `Windows Defender Scheduled Scan`.

### 1.3 Clear Protection History (For Perfectionists)

To fix stubborn yellow warning icons that won't go away:

1. **Take Ownership**: Use a "Take Ownership" script on `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\History\Service`.
2. **Physical Deletion**: Delete the `DetectionHistory` folder inside.
3. *If access is denied, perform this in **Safe Mode**.*

## 2. Storage Space Recovery (The 29GB Secret)

### 2.1 Enable LZX Compression

Uses Windows' hidden transparent compression without a noticeable performance hit.

* **System OS Compression**:
```powershell
compact /compactos:always

```


* **Manual App Compression** (For large software/games):
```powershell
compact /c /s /a /i /exe:lzx "C:\Program Files\YourApp\*"

```



### 2.2 Remove Redundant Reserves & Cache

* **Disable Hibernation & Fast Startup** (Saves several GBs):
```powershell
powercfg -h off

```


* **Disable Reserved Storage** (Saves ~7GB):
```powershell
DISM.exe /Online /Set-ReservedStorageState /State:Disabled

```



### 2.3 Cleanup Old Drivers & Update Backups

One of the most effective ways to reclaim space (Note: Updates cannot be uninstalled after this):

```powershell
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase

```

### 2.4 Virtual Memory (PageFile) Optimization

For 8GB RAM devices, prevent C: drive fluctuations caused by "System Managed" paging files.

* **Recommendation**: Set static size. Initial: `4096MB`, Maximum: `8192MB`.
